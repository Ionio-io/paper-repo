**Ionio-Research** is the dedicated research arm of [Ionio.ai](https://www.ionio.ai), focused on building intelligent, scalable, and responsible AI-driven systems.

We explore real-world challenges and convert them into research-backed solutions — spanning LLMs, knowledge graphs, AI agents, multimodal systems, and explainable machine learning.

<!-- ![Ionio Research](public/astropaper-og.jpg) -->

Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic research and production-ready AI tools, offering actionable insights, reproducible experiments, and open-source prototypes.
